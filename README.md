# Balancr
An android app written in kotlin, designed to make the process of balancing chemical equations easier.

This app was created using Android Studio, targets OS version 4.0 and supports androidX artifacts.

I don't really have a roadmap for this yet, it's really just a little side project, but if anyone wants to make a little TODO that works for me.

It's a calculator app that extends a bit past the basic operators everyones familar with.
